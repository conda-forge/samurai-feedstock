  summary: Intervals coupled with algebra of set to handle adaptive mesh refinement and operators on it
  description: |
    samurai allows to implement several mesh adaptation methods (patch-based, cell-based, point-based)
    from the same data structure. The mesh is represented as intervals and a set algebra allows to efficiently
    search for subsets among these intervals. Samurai also offers a flexible and pleasant interface to easily
    implement numerical methods.
